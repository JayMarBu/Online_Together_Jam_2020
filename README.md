# Online_Together_Jam_2020
Team Royalty's repo for the 2020 Abertay University "Online Together" game jam.

To setup and use, you will need to add Mirror from the assets store, it is free to use, but i decided not to include it in the repository inorder to save space. When loading a scene it will also probably ask to add text mesh pro which you should also do.
